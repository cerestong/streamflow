Notes

Compiling:
	- In the Makefile, define a META_METHOD as one of HEADERS,
	  BIBOP or RADIX_TREE. All architectures support HEADERS. Only 
	  32-bit architectures support BIBOP, and only 64-bit architectures
	  support RADIX_TREE.
	- In the Makefile, define ASM as either x86 or ppc64. These are the 
	  only supported architectures at this time.

gcc 3.3.4:
	- Streamflow does not compile with gcc 3.3.4; it causes an internal 
	  compiler error when full optimizations are turned on. It has been 
	  successfuly compiled with gcc 4.0.2 and gcc 3.4.5.

Superpages:
	- Streamflow expects superpages to be mounted on /mnt/huge.
	- Multiple processes can use superpages, but they communicate 
	  through the file system. Files created in /tmp/supermap are 
	  considered legal superpage names. Successfuly unlinking a file 
	  in /tmp/supermap claims ownership of that file name, and allows 
	  a process to use it in /mnt/huge. Files must be recreated on 
	  each subsequent run.

Machine dependent files:
	- atomic.h and bitops.h are taken from the Linux kernel source, 
	  with minor modifications.
